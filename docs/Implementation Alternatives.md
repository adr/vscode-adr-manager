# Implementation Alternatives

This document lists several alternatives to implement a certain requirement. Each alternative is labeled with a suitability to fulfill the requirement which is determined by how usable the alternative is and how easy it is to implement the alternative in VS Code. The suitability can be 'well suited', 'moderately suited' and 'not suited'.

Each implementation alternative of a requirement will be given an ID in the form AX (where X is replaced with a number)that is unique for the particular requirement. To adress specific implementation alternatives, the combination of requirement ID and alternative ID can be used, e.g., the first alternative of the first requirement would be R1A1.

## Terminology

For this document, it is useful to establish some terminology that will be used throughout:

<br/>

<b><i>VS Code command</i></b>:
A VS Code command (or simply command) is a trigger that the user can use to execute certain actions in VS Code. Besides built-in commands, extensions may also be managed and used by providing custom commands.<br/>
The user can execute commands by either opening the VS Code Command Palette (by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) or by setting a command to a key bind.

<b><i>VS Code workspace</i></b>:
A VS Code workspace (or simply workspace) is 'the collection of one or more folders that are opened in a VS Code window (instance)' (see the [official VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces)). Once a folder has been added to the workspace, it is possible to navigate through that folder by using the explorer on the left side in VS Code.<br/>
For this extension, we will differentiate between single-root workspaces and multi-root workspaces, i.e., the extension may behave differently when there are multiple folders open at the same time in a single VS Code window.

<b><i>VS Code Webview API</i></b>:
The [VS Code Webview API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview) (in the following called webview) allows the user to render custom HTML content in a separate frame that is controlled by the extension. The communication between the webview and the extension takes place via sending and receiving messages. Webviews can be displayed as distinct editors using <i>Webview Panels</i> or in the sidebar or panel areas of VS Code using <i>Webview views</i>.<br/>
The advantage of using webviews is the flexibility to build custom user interfaces that would otherwise not be possible using only the VS Code API. Also, frameworks like Vue.js can be built on top of webviews to further enhance the functionality, making it possible to integrate whole websites into VS Code.<br/>
Some implementation alternatives may also be based upon the fact that a webview will be used in the implementation which makes webviews even more attractive.

<b><i>Vue.js</i></b>:
[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) (or simply Vue) is one of the most popular JavaScript framework for creating web user interfaces. One of its main features is the ability to modularize the interface into single <i>components</i> that can be reused across multiple websites. This makes the website more maintainable and reduces redundancy.<br/>
It is important to note that the original ADR Manager itself is built using Vue 2, which would reduce the workload and help to maintain the feel of the original if Vue would be used in the extension as well.

## Implementation Alternatives for each Requirement

### R1: Adding new ADRs to the local repository

| ID  | Alternative                                                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Suitability       | Reason                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| A1  | Using a command to render a webview with multiple input fields for adding new ADRs | The user executes a command to open a webview with a user interface where he can enter and edit ADR information to his liking, along with a 'Save' button at the bottom that creates a Markdown file of the ADR and saves it in the workspace. | well suited       | By using a webview, the user interface of the ADR Manager can be reused or at least be based off of it, thus making the implementation easy and reminiscent of the original ADR Manager.              |
| A2  | Using a command to ask the user to input the ADR information one field at a time   | The user executes a command which prompts him to enter all ADR information one field at a time. The input field appears at the top of the window (where the command palette would appear).                                                     | moderately suited | While being unobtrusive, the user won't be able to change their inputs once a field has been filled out. This makes the implementation susceptible to user errors which negatively impacts usability. |

### R2: Editing existing ADRs

| A1  | Using a command to render a webview where an ADR can be chosen to be edited                               | The user executes a command to open a webview where he can choose between ADRs that exist inside frequent paths on the workspace. The webview then displays multiple input fields that are filled with existing information which can be edited and saved by the user.                                                                            | well suited       | By using a webview, the user interface of the ADR Manager can be reused or at least be based off of it, thus making the implementation easy and reminiscent of the original ADR Manager (see also R1A1).                                                                                                                            |
| A2  | Add a new submenu when right-clicking on a Markdown file and select an option to edit using the extension | The user can right-click on a Markdown file (ideally a file that he knows is an ADR) to select an option to edit the ADR using the extension. If the selected markdown file is not an ADR, i.e., if it does not conform to the MADR template, the extension will notify the user and try to convert the Markdown to conform to the MADR template. | well suited       | This option could be implemented in parallel to another alternative listed in this table as it is intuitive and common to select the file directly from the workspace. This alternative can be seen as a shortcut for editing ADRs if the user already knows exactly which ADR to edit and where the ADR is saved in the workspace. |
| A3  | Using a command to edit specific fields of an ADR                                                         | The user executes a command which prompts him to select an existing ADR in the workspace and then specify a certain field of the ADR that he would like to change. The user is then shown the current value of the requested field and is asked to update the value.                                                                              | not suited        | The user should be able to see all fields of an ADR and their corresponding values at once such that the user doesn't have to know beforehand which fields need changes. It is also impractical to be able to change only one field at a time compared to changing multiple filds at once.                                          |
| A4  | Using the Markdown editor provided by VS Code to edit ADRs 'by hand' (built-in in VS Code)                | The user opens the existing ADR that he wants to edit using the built-in Markdown editor to make and save changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | moderately suited | While this method may be quick (especially for power users), there may be users who are not familiar with writing raw Markdown. Additionally, the user may run into a problem with formatting and keeping the ADR consistent to other ADRs, which would otherwise be handled by a template with given input fields.                 |

| A1  | Using a webview to display the MADR template along with input fields which the user can fill out | The user can let the extension render a webview which provides multiple input fields with labels that follow the MADR template. | well suited       | By using a webview, the user interface of the ADR Manager can be reused or at least be based off of it, thus making the implementation easy and reminiscent of the original ADR Manager (see also R1A1 and R2A1).                                                                                                         |
| A2  | Using a command to generate a Markdown file that follows the MADR template                       | The user can execute a command which generates a template Markdown file which he can fill out.                                  | moderately suited | Although very easy to implement, it would make more sense to let the user directly fill out an ADR upon generation rather than having the user to separately generate and fill out an ADR. If the user still wants to have a blank template, he may leave every field empty, resulting in a blank Markdown template file. |

### R4: Provide an ADR parser and converter

| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A1  | Import and use the ADR parser and converter of the original ADR Manager as modules | Reuse the parser and the converter that has been written for the original ADR Manager. | well suited | Because the original ADR Manager is written in JavaScript, it is possible to reuse the code of the ADR Manager. This reduces the workload and may be less prone to bugs and errors compared to writing a parser and converter from scratch. |

| A1  | <b>When using a webview</b>: Use and show validation for each input field of the ADR | When the user fills out an ADR using a webview, i.e., filling out multiple input fields, the extension will dynamically validate user inputs and display errors messages for each input field if the user's input is invalid. The user may only save the ADR if all validations have passed without any errors. | well suited       | By using a webview along with Vue, the validation of user inputs becomes simple to implement without being too obtrusive to the user. A library like [vuelidate](https://vuelidate.js.org/) could be beneficial in this case.                                                                                   |
| A2  | Show VS Code error messages in case of invalid inputs                                | When the user input is invalid, prompt VS Code to produce an error message that will pop up as a box on the bottom right corner of the VS Code window, along with a description of why the input is invalid. In that case, the extension will ask the user to try again using a valid input.                    | moderately suited | While easy to implement using the Extension API, the window may become too cluttered from error messages popping up. It may also be uncomfortable for the user to keep switching the gaze from the input field to the error message to figure out what went wrong, thus hurting the usability of the extension. |

| A1  | <b>When using a webview</b>: Let the extension automatically scan frequent paths for Markdown files that can then be selected in the webview for viewing and editing | When the user chooses the option to view or edit an ADR in the webview, the extension will treat all Markdown files (files ending with .md) in frequent paths in the current workspace as ADRs and lists them in the webview for the user to select. If a Markdown file does not conform to the MADR template, the extension will mark that particular file and the user will be asked to convert the markdown file such that it adheres to the MADR template upon selecting the file for viewing or editing. The conversion would be done automatically by a parser and converter, like the ones from the original ADR Manager (see R4). | well suited       | This alternative may be a bit harder to implement, but it would bundle the functionality of the extension inside a single webview which allows the user to focus on only one part of the VS Code window to perform his tasks. |
| A2  | Use a command to scan for files in the workspace that may be ADRs                                                                                                    | The user can execute a command which prompts the extension to scan the workspace for files that may be ADRs (typically Markdown files). Afterwards, the extension lets the user choose from a list of potential ADRs and choose an action to perform (view, edit etc.).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | moderately suited | This alternative may have a confusing workflow because the intended action (viewing ADRs, editing ADRs etc.) is gated behind another action that may not be the action the user intends to use.                               |

### R8: Delete existing ADRs

| ID | Alternative | Description | Suitability | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Use the webview to delete ADRs | The user can delete ADRs that are located in the current workspace and that have been detected by the extension (see R6) via the webview. | moderately suited | While this requirement may seem redundant because the user can already delete files via the file explorer in VS Code, it is mainly intended for the user to use the webview to use features related to managing ADRs. If the extension's webview does not list the option to delete already existing ADRs, the user might get confused as to why there is no delete option, and this may result in an awkward workflow that is different to workflows that include other features of this extension. |
| A2 | Use the VS Code file explorer to delete ADRs (VS Code built-in) | The user can manually delete ADRs by using the file explorer in VS Code. | moderately suited | see reason for R8A1 |

### R16: Supporting images in an ADR

| ID | Alternative | Description | Suitability | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Use Markdown to include images to ADRs | The user can choose images that he wants to include in an ADR upon adding or editing an ADR. When saving the ADR, the extension will generate Markdown that includes the specified image(s). The images will be saved in a separate "images" folder inside the ADR folder. | well suited | Since the extension handles ADRs that are documented in Markdown, it would only be logical to use Markdown to embed images in them. |
