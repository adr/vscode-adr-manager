## Observations while solving tasks

### Tasks without extension

Task 1:

* decided to copy the professional MADR template to the correct subfolder as the meeting summary contained more information than just the mandatory fields of the basic MADR template
renamed the copied file according to the naming convention of MADR (including using the decision outcome as a title)
* started to fill in the placeholders of the template, leaving out fields that were not given in the meeting summary
* replaced the section '"...", because ...' Of the decision outcome with the content of the 'Outcome' section of the meeting summary
* used the pros of the chosen option as justification of the decision outcome
* stated that the consequences are not explicitly documented in the meeting summary, chose to use the pros of the chosen option as positive consequences and the cons of the chosen option as negative consequences
* copied pros and cons of the options from the meeting summary to the MADR


Task 2:

* read through the ADR, did not find any issues
* compared the faulty ADR with the basic MADR template, found that the title header was missing and fixed the issue


### Tasks with extension

Task 1:

* opened the main webview of the extension by right-clicking on an ADR directory and clicking on the menu item 'Open ADR Manager'
* confused where to select the 'IT' subfolder as the location to save the new ADR, carried on with creating the new ADR
* copied the information of the meeting summary to the Basic Editor of the extension
* switched to the Professional Editor to fill in additional fields
* could not see the option title input field because the Webex overlay blocked the VS Code window
* added the first option mentioned in the meeting summary and expanded the option to add the pros and cons of the option, correctly enters one argument for each input field
* fills in the information for the second option
* used the pros of the chosen option as justification of the decision outcome because the justification was not explicitly documented in the meeting summary
* copies the consequences to the ADR editor
* created the ADR and found out that the subfolder can be chosen at this point

Task 2:

* conductor hinted at a bug that made it impossible for the participant to detect the issue with the ADR editor, instructed the participant to open the ADR with the VS Code Markdown editor
* saw that the editor displayed an error, fixed the issue


## Personal feedback for the VS Code Extension of the ADR Manager (free form)

* useful for keeping the documentation consistent, especially important if the ADRs are used for further automated tasks
* would personally use the extension in projects if their projects didn't use Confluence for the documentation
* tool support for documentation is meaningful
