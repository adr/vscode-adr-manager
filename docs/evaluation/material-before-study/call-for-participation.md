# Call for Participation

Hello! My name is Steven Chen and I am currently writing my Bachelor's thesis at the University of Stuttgart. As part of my thesis, I have created a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (VS Code) extension for the [ADR Manager](https://adr.github.io/adr-manager), a web-based tool for documenting and managing [Architectural Decision Records](https://adr.github.io) (ADRs) in the 2.1.2 version of the [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr) format in GitHub repositories.

I am looking for software professionals to test my extension of the ADR Manager as an IDE plugin which provides ADR management features based on local folders instead of GitHub repositories. 

Participants should bring a basic understanding and experience in the use of ADRs. Particular experience in using MADR is beneficial, but is not strictly required.
Participants should also be familiar with the core features and the workflow of the VS Code IDE.

To save some time in the study, I would kindly ask participants to familiarize themselves with the features of the ADR extension before the study. For this, I have created a [repository](https://github.com/stevenchencb/vscode-adr-manager-introduction) which briefly introduces the current features of the extension (estimated time: 5-7 minutes).

\<Sign-up (maybe online)\>

The material of this study will be provided in English but the study itself may be held in either German or English, based on the participant's preference. The study will be held in [WebEx](https://www.webex.com).


## Purpose

In this study, the VS Code extension for the ADR Manager will be evaluated based on several small tasks that need to be solved by the participant. In particular, the usability of the extension will be reviewed in the context of an IDE.
With the help of software professionals experienced with ADRs, I hope to gain valuable insights on the usefulness of ADR tooling that is integrated in an IDE.


## Study Procedure

This study is split into two parts:

1. The participant will be given two lists of small tasks where one list has to be solved explicitly without the help of the VS Code extension and the other list with the help of the extension. The task completion time for each list will be recorded for future analysis.
2. The participant will be briefly interviewed on the usability of the extension.

The estimated time for the study is between 40 and 60 minutes.

For this study, I would kindly ask you to share your screen and also think aloud while solving the given tasks. I would also like to ask you for your permission to record the meeting, including the shared screen and the audio of the meeting.

The recording will be used to create a case description for each participant which highlights the most important statement of the study with regard to the VS Code extension.
The case description will be anonymized and the recording will then be destroyed. The anonymized case descriptions will then be the sole basis for the analysis.


## Privacy Policy

The data collected in this study will be treated as strictly confidential and will not be disclosed to any third-party not involved in this study. The results will be aggregated and anonymized before publication such that it will not be possible to trace any statements back to an individual participant.
The anonymized case descriptions (as well as their analysis and their results) will be made available as part of the publication. Recordings of meetings and unapproved case descriptions will not be published, and any raw data from this study will be deleted by September 21, 2022.

Participation in this study is strictly voluntary. It is the right of every participant to withdraw from this study at any point of time without a reason.


I would be very happy to hear about your participation in this study!
