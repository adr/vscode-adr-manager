# Study Procedure

The study is divided into two parts:

1. The participant will solve several small tasks, some without and some with the use of the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (VS Code) extension for the ADR Manager
2. Short interview about the experience of using the plugin (based on the [System Usability Scale](http://www.tbistafftraining.info/smartphones/documents/b5_during_the_trial_usability_scale_v1_09aug11.pdf))


## Prerequisites for Participants

* Computer with keyboard, mouse, microphone and access to the Internet, webcam optional
* Video conferencing tool [WebEx](https://www.webex.com)
* VS Code IDE installed
* VS Code extension for the ADR Manager installed
* Knowledge about the use of the ADR Manager extension (e.g. using the provided [repository](https://github.com/stevenchencb/vscode-adr-manager-introduction))


## Material Provided by the Organizers

* [Repository](https://github.com/stevenchencb/vscode-adr-manager-introduction) for introducing the features of the ADR Manager extension to the participant
* Task lists (including additional documents) for tasks solved without and tasks solved with the plugin


## Procedure

* The participant's screen is shared in the WebEx meeting
* The organizers of the evaluation record the audio and video of the WebEx meeting (with consent)
* The participant will be given the task lists along with additional material to solve the tasks
* The participant opens the folder 'task-folder' in a VS Code instance
* The participant solves the tasks given in the task lists while thinking out loud
* The participant will be interviewed regarding the experience of using the plugin and, in particular, its usability
