# Study Procedure

The study is divided into two parts:

1. The participant will solve several small tasks, some without and some with the use of the VS Code plugin for the ADR Manager
2. Short interview about the experience of using the plugin (based on the [System Usability Scale](http://www.tbistafftraining.info/smartphones/documents/b5_during_the_trial_usability_scale_v1_09aug11.pdf))


## Prerequisites for Participants

* Computer with keyboard, mouse, microphone and access to the Internet, webcam optional
* Video conferencing tool [WebEx](https://www.webex.com)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) IDE


## Material Provided by the Organizers

* VS Code plugin for the ADR Manager (through the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode))
* Task lists (including additional documents) for tasks solved without and tasks solved with the plugin


## Procedure

* The participant's screen is shared in the WebEx meeting
* The organizers of the evaluation record the audio and video of the WebEx meeting (with consent)
* The participant will be given the task lists along with additional material to solve the tasks
* The participant opens the folder 'task-folder' in a VS Code instance
* (Depending on the tasks, the participant installs the VS Code plugin for the ADR Manager via the Visual Studio Code Marketplace and is given time to read the description of the plugin to familiarize himself with the features of the plugin)
* The participant solves the tasks given in the task lists while thinking out loud
* The participant will be interviewed regarding the experience of using the plugin and, in particular, its usability
