# Task List (without Extension)

For these tasks, you may use the provided MADR templates (`madr-template-basic.md` and `madr-template-professional.md`) in case you are not familiar with the MADR format. You should open them outside of VS Code if you decide to use them.

1. Open the folder `Snackato Inc.` in a VS Code instance (if not done already). This folder should be the only folder in the VS Code workspace, i.e., it is the only root folder in the file system explorer of  VS Code.
2. Read the meeting summary `rnd-meeting-summary.md`
3. Create a new MADR in the correct subdirectory of the folder `Snackato Inc.` and fill the MADR with information according to the file `rnd-meeting-summary.md`.
4. There seems to be something wrong with the existing MADR `Snackato Inc./Marketing/docs/decisions/0001-use-tiktok-for-advertisement.md`. Find and fix the issue (the organizer will tell you if the problem has been fixed).
