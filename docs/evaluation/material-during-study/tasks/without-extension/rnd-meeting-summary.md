# Snackato Inc. Meeting Summary

Department: Research & Development

Topic: Choosing the Flavor of the New Snackato Inc. Product

Date: July 29, 2022

Participants: Tato Salaad, Fry French, Sebago Baker


## Context

Snackato Inc. wants to release a new arrangement of products with a new flavor profile. What flavor should we aim to recreate?


## Options

* Tato proposes 'Mayonnaise' flavor for the new products
* Fry wants to introduce an 'Animal Style' flavor, based on the 'Animal Style Fries' from the fast-food chain 'In-N-Out Burger'
* Sebago prefers a flavor based on the Australian food spread 'Vegemite'


## Discussion

* Mayonnaise:
    * Pros:
        * Simple flavor to recreate
    * Cons:
        * Flavor may be too basic
        * There are already products with that flavor on the market

* Animal Style:
    * Pros:
        * In-N-Out burger is cherished as one of the best fast-food chains in the U.S.
        * Unique flavor profile that no other competitor has used
    * Cons:
        * Fees for using the trademarked 'Animal Style' flavor/brand

* Vegemite:
    * Pros:
        * Liked by Australians
    * Cons:
        * Notoriously hated by non-Australians
        * Fees for using the trademarked 'Vegemite' flavor/brand


## Outcome

Animal Style was selected as the new flavor to recreate for the new Snackato Inc. products.
