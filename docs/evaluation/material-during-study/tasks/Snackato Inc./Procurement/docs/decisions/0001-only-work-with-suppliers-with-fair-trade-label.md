## Context and Problem Statement

Snackato Inc. highly values the well-being of every employee/farmer etc. throughout the whole suppy chain. Which suppliers should we consider to work with?

## Decision Drivers

* Employees must be paid adequately
* Suppliers must be regulated/controlled by an independent third party

* Suppliers with the lowest costs

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Suppliers with Fair Trade Label", because employee's working conditions should be kept at a high standard throughout the whole supply chain.

### Positive Consequences

* Good public image for Snackato Inc.
* A good conscience

### Negative Consequences

* Slightly higher costs

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Suppliers with Fair Trade Label

Suppliers who are Fair Trade Certified guarantee that farmers receive a minimum price for their produce set by the Fair Trade USA organization.

* Good, because no exploitation of farmers
* Good, because strictly regulated by an independent organization
* Bad, because slightly higher prices for procurement

### Suppliers with the lowest costs

Do not assess the working conditions of the supplier's employees, focusing on the lowest possible cost for Snackato Inc.

* Good, because lower costs
* Bad, because high probability of employee exploitation
* Bad, because bad reputation for Snackato Inc. for sourcing products from exploiting suppliers
