# Task List (with Extension)

1. Open the folder `Snackato Inc.` in a VS Code instance (if not done already). This folder should be the only folder in the VS Code workspace, i.e., it is the only root folder in the file system explorer of  VS Code.
2. Create a new MADR in the correct subdirectory of the folder `Snackato Inc.` according to the file `it-meeting-summary.md`.
3. There seems to be something wrong with the existing MADR `Snackato Inc./Procurement/0001-only-work-with-suppliers-wit-fair-trade-label.md`. Find and fix the issue (the organizer will tell you if the problem has been fixed).
