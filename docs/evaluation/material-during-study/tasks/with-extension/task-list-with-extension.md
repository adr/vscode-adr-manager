# Task List (with Extension)

1. Open the folder `task-folder` in a VS Code instance (if not done already). This folder should be the only folder in the VS Code workspace, i.e., it is the only root folder in the file system explorer of  VS Code.
2. Create a new MADR in the correct subdirectory of the folder `task-folder` according to the file `filename`.
3. There seems to be something wrong with the existing MADR `path-to-invalid-madr`. Find and fix the issue (the organizer will tell you if the problem has been fixed).
