Topic: Discussing Techniques to Gain Insights from Data

Date: June 16, 2022

Participants: Carl E. Frie, Rob O'Tadow


## Context

In this day and age, information is the most valuable resource a business can have. How can we generate insights from raw data that will be beneficial for supporting business decisions?

**Considerations to keep in mind**: Even small competitive advantages play a big role as the market is already very saturated.

## Options

* Carl wants to try out Data Mining
* Rob does not believe in the value of information: 'Do not analyze raw data'


## Discussion

* Data Mining:
    * Pros:
        * High potential of uncovering patterns that are useful for strategic decisions
        * Usage of every resource available to the business
        * Potential catalyst for innovation
        * Can be extended in the future, automatically deriving and executing decisions based on the results of data mining (Predictive/Prescriptive Analytics)
    * Cons:
        * Consumes time and money
        * Proficiency in Advanced Analytics needed

* Not Analyzing Data:
    * Pros:
        * Saves time and money
    * Cons:
        * Competitors will have the advantage in the market
        * Waste of available resource 'information'
        * Antique view on information may deter future IT employees


## Outcome

Data Mining was chosen to be used for gaining insights from data.


## Consequences of the Decision

    * Potential to gain a competitive edge in the market
    * Data Mining may help with finding good business decisions for Snackato Inc.
    * Attract employees interested working in the field of Data Science
