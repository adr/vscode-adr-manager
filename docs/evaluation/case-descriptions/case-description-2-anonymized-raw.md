## Observations while solving tasks

### Tasks without extension

Task 1:

* chose the correct subdirectory for creating the new MADR
* duplicated the existing MADR as a reference for the new MADR
* copied the data from the meeting summary and replaced the data in the duplicated file
* kept pros and cons of the options in the 'Considered Options' section, organizer didn't intervene because MADR does not force the user to strictly follow the format, MADR was still complete


Task 2:

* noticed right away that the title heading is missing

### Tasks with extension

Task 1:

* chose the correct subdirectory for creating the new MADR
* used the command 'Add New ADR' to create a new MADR
* said initial red fields generally correct because fields are missing values
* stated that decisions can also be pending, i.e. having no chosen option, input rule for having exactly one chosen option seemed too restrictive
* felt that the UI is clear
* said that fields in the provided editor can be matched nicely with the fields from the MADR template or the meeting summary
* started to fill out the basic editor with the data from the meeting summary
* noted that one cannot choose an option before having added any options, participant found this restriction logical
* said that automatically choosing an option is nice in general, but participant would also want to have the option to not have any chosen option for an ADR
* had small problems with choosing an option, but discovered the 'click-to-choose' functionality quickly after
* found the clicking on an option is a user friendly and fast way of choosing an option
* copied the consequences to the explanation field as the meeting summary did not have an explicit explanation for the decision outcome
* saved the ADR after filling out all fields of the basic editor mode
* when the prompt to choose the target folder popped up, the participant tried to enter the file name
* after saving the ADR, participant noticed that the font of the ADR Manager logo is different
* stated that users may be confused to be directed to the main webview of the extension after creating a new ADR
* quickly matched the list of ADRs in the main webview with the ADRs present in the workspace
* noted that the description text for dragging options to arrange them may be too short
* did not see the toggle to switch editor modes because the WebEx UI was covering the toggle
* opened the newly created ADR in the professional editor mode
* found that the UI was nicely structured
* found that the fonts and sizes of the elements were good
* expected that the arrows for expanding options to be reversed
* copied all pros and cons to a single input field each
* added metadata to the ADR
* found tooltips nice (tooltips should give more information than the labels, but should also not deviate too much from the label)


Task 2:

* immediately noticed the linting error, fixed error with the help of the listing error
* tested linting features by removing titles, MADR sections etc.
* found that the warnings are very well integrated
* noted that tools should not be too restrictive / commanding to the user, e.g. warnings should have an observational character instead of being formulated like an accusation


## Personal feedback for the VS Code Extension of the ADR Manager (free form)

* manageable, well considered functionality
* found that the extension could be used even without prior introduction to the extension
* extension made a clear impression and felt easy to use
